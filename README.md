# Khaba Backend

The backend for a 3rd place winning hackathon project built with Express/Node. Uses MongoDB.

The problem domain was to solve food insecurity so we focused solving food waste and food redistribution.

This app tracks wasted food and then plans a route to collect all the wasted food and redistribute them.

The backend stores data and serves them through a REST API.

How to run:
1. Clone the repo
2. run npm i in the terminal inside the repo
3. run npm start in the terminal inside the repo
